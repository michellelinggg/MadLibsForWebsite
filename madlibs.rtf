Once upon a time there lived a beautiful princess named Daisy. She had many admirers who loved her. All day and all night they would stand outside her window hoping she would notice them. Everyone thought Daisy was perfect. But Daisy had a secret - she was cursed. Every night at midnight, a sweet smell would cross her room and she would quickly turn into a dragon. She would then go to the neighboring city of Chacha Town and eat a horse. The horse she chose always smelled so fantastic she couldn't help herself. One night however, a curious stableboy named Melvin happened to be walking by when he noticed Daisy. He was so surprised he didn't know what to do so he began to sing loudly. Upon noticing Melvin, Daisy immediately stopped what she was doing. She then walked up to Melvin and sniffed him. Because he didn't smell that bad, she kissed him and the curse was broken.
